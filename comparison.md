# Gatekeeper Advantages

Capable of expressing very complex policy
More establishment in the community
Supports multiple replicas for availability and scale

# Gatekeeper Disadvantages

Requiring a programming language is a serious learning curve which generates large amounts of technical debt and increases time to value
Mutation ability is in nascent stage
Policy is complex, often lengthy, and requires multiple documents to implement



# Kyverno Advantages

Dramatic simplicity of policy expression allowing Kubernetes-style composition
Solid mutation abilities
Supports multiple replicas for availability and scale
Generation and syncing ability is unique and allows new use cases
Quick time to value and high degree of flexibility

# Kyverno Disadvantages

Highly complex policy may not be possible since no programming language is exposed
Young, still largely unproven due to lower establishment



# JsPolicy Advantages

Lightning Fast & Secure Policy Execution
JavaScript is made for handling and manipulating JSON objects
Simple yet Powerful, Create a functional webhook with a single line of JavaScript or write your own fully blown custom StatefulSet controller in TypeScript with jsPolicy.
Share entire policies or reusable functions via npmjs or via your private registry



# JsPolicy Disadvantages

Young, not very large community
